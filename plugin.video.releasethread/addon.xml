        <broken>The End is here - We are closing ReleaseThread With a heavy heart the day has come where we part once again. By forces that we cannot control - we have to close by today. Even though our journey ends today, It is definitely not over. Who knows what end of the rainbow you might find us where the internet will one day be free again. Forgive us for all our trespass and hope we meet again! From all the Staff and Admin of ReleaseThread</broken>
